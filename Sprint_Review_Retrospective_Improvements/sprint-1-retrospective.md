# Sprint 1 Retrospective

Date: 15th

## Participants
- Emily (Product Owner)
- Onthangalo (Scrum Master)
- Richard (Developer)
- Tshepiso (Team Member)

## What Went Well
- Core booking functionality delivered and usable
- Dependencies respected by completing Story #1 first
- Task-based daily standups improved focus and transparency

## What Didn’t Go Well
- Sprint was overcommitted beyond realistic velocity
- Complex stories were accepted without fully refined acceptance criteria

## Start
- Refining acceptance criteria for complex stories during backlog refinement
- Identifying external dependencies earlier in sprint planning

## Stop
- Treating stretch stories as guaranteed deliverables
- Estimating complex logic without clear resolution rules

## Continue
- Incremental delivery of dependent features
- Honest sprint reviews and scope-based decision-making

## Team Reflection
“Delivering fewer stable features provided more value than partially completing many features.”  
— Richard (Developer)
