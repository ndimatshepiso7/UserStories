## Sprint Goal
Enable employees to book conference rooms with essential constraints such as availability, capacity, and cancellation.

## Sprint Goal Outcome
Partially Met

## User Impact Snapshot
Employees can now reliably book meeting rooms without manual coordination.
Users can view room availability, filter rooms by capacity, and cancel bookings, freeing rooms for others.
This reduces scheduling friction and improves meeting efficiency.

## Completed Stories

| Story # | Title | Acceptance Criteria Met |
|-------:|-------|-------------------------|
| 1 | Basic Room Booking | Yes |
| 3 | Room Capacity Filtering | Yes |

## Incomplete Stories

| Story # | Reason | Decision |
|-------:|--------|----------|
| 4 | Core cancellation worked, but email confirmation and edge-case validation were incomplete | Carry over |
| 5 | Deferred to protect sprint goal and prioritise booking stability | Carry over |
| 9 | Acceptance criteria unclear and conflict logic more complex than estimated | Rewrite |
