# Sprint 1 Personal Reflection

Name: Tshepiso

## Key Learning
This sprint showed me the importance of protecting the Definition of Done rather than trying to complete too many features at once. Delivering fewer but stable features provided more real value than partially completing many stories.

## Assumptions That Failed
I assumed that complex user stories, such as conflict resolution and advanced filtering, could be completed within the sprint without fully refined acceptance criteria. This led to overcommitment and highlighted gaps in our estimation approach.

## Behavioural Change
In future sprints, I will ensure that acceptance criteria for complex stories are clearly defined before committing them to a sprint. I will also pay closer attention to dependencies and technical risks during sprint planning.

## Collaboration Insight
Working with clearly defined Scrum roles and multiple team members improved communication and accountability. Sprint discussions and reviews helped me better understand how product decisions and technical trade-offs are made collaboratively.

## Sprint Health Indicator
🟡 Slight overcommitment  
🟢 Quality protected  
🟢 Usable product delivered
